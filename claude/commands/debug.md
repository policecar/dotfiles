# Debug Issue

Systematically debug the reported issue:

1. **Reproduce**: Understand the exact steps to reproduce the problem
2. **Isolate**: Identify the specific component/function where the issue occurs
3. **Root Cause**: Trace through the code to find the underlying cause
4. **Fix**: Implement a minimal, targeted fix
5. **Verify**: Confirm the fix resolves the issue without breaking other functionality

Be methodical. Verify assumptions with actual code inspection. No guessing.
