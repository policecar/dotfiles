# Code Review

Perform a thorough code review of recent changes, checking for:

1. **Security Issues**: OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, command injection, etc.)
2. **Code Quality**: Unnecessary abstractions, over-engineering, unused code
3. **Best Practices**: Error handling, edge cases, performance concerns
4. **Consistency**: Code style, naming conventions, patterns used elsewhere in the codebase

Provide direct, actionable feedback. Flag issues clearly and suggest specific fixes.
