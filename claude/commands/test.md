# Write Tests

Write comprehensive tests for the specified code:

1. **Analyze**: Understand what the code does and its edge cases
2. **Strategy**: Determine test approach (unit, integration, etc.)
3. **Cases**: Identify:
   - Happy path scenarios
   - Edge cases
   - Error conditions
   - Boundary values
4. **Implement**: Write clear, focused tests
5. **Verify**: Run tests and confirm they pass

Write tests that would actually catch bugs. No tests for getters/setters unless they have logic.
