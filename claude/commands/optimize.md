# Optimize Performance

Analyze and optimize performance:

1. **Measure**: Identify actual bottlenecks (profiling, metrics, not guesses)
2. **Analyze**: Understand why the bottleneck exists
3. **Solutions**: Propose specific optimizations with expected impact
4. **Implement**: Make targeted changes
5. **Verify**: Measure improvement

Only optimize real bottlenecks. Don't prematurely optimize or add complexity for theoretical gains.
