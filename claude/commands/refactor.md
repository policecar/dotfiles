# Refactor

Refactor the specified code:

1. **Current State**: Analyze existing code structure and issues
2. **Goals**: Clarify specific refactoring objectives
3. **Plan**: Outline refactoring steps
4. **Execute**: Make changes incrementally
5. **Verify**: Ensure behavior unchanged (run tests if available)

Rules:
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Don't add features or change behavior
- Don't create abstractions unless there are 3+ similar uses
- Delete dead code completely
- Preserve all existing tests
