# Architecture Analysis

Analyze the current codebase architecture:

1. **Structure**: Identify main components, modules, and their relationships
2. **Patterns**: Document architectural patterns in use (MVC, microservices, etc.)
3. **Dependencies**: Map key dependencies between components
4. **Issues**: Flag architectural smells, tight coupling, circular dependencies
5. **Improvements**: Suggest specific, actionable improvements

Focus on facts and concrete issues. No hypothetical future scenarios unless specifically relevant.
