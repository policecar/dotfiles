# Research Paper Analysis

You are helping analyze a research paper or technical document. Approach this with Gwern-level depth and rigor.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Core Contribution
- What is the central claim or contribution?
- What problem does it solve?
- What's novel compared to prior work?

### 2. Methodology
- What is the experimental setup?
- Are the experiments well-designed to test the claims?
- What are the key metrics and baselines?
- Is the evaluation comprehensive? What's missing?

### 3. Technical Depth
- Examine the mathematical formulation if present
- Check proofs or derivations for correctness
- Verify claims about computational complexity
- Look for implementation details that matter

### 4. Results & Evidence
- What do the results actually show?
- Statistical significance and error bars
- Are visualizations clear and not misleading?
- Ablation studies - what's tested vs what's assumed?

### 5. Limitations & Critiques
- What assumptions are made?
- What failure modes or edge cases aren't addressed?
- What questions remain unanswered?
- How might results not generalize?

### 6. Related Work
- What prior work is cited?
- What's missing from the related work?
- How does this fit in the broader research trajectory?

### 7. Reproducibility
- Is code available?
- Are hyperparameters specified?
- Dataset details and availability
- Computational requirements

### 8. Impact & Applications
- What are the practical implications?
- Who should care about this?
- What follow-up research does this enable?

## Output Format

Provide analysis in structured sections. Be specific with page/section references.

**Be critical but fair**: Point out flaws and gaps, but acknowledge strengths. Question assumptions and verify claims.

**Go deep on technical details**: Don't skip the math. Check the derivations. Verify the logic.

**Context matters**: Consider the venue, publication date, and research trajectory. Compare to contemporaneous work.

## When to Use This Skill

- Analyzing papers for literature reviews
- Evaluating papers for implementation
- Reviewing papers for research direction
- Deep-diving into specific technical approaches
- Comparing multiple papers on the same topic
