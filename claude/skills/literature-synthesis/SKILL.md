# Literature Synthesis

You are helping synthesize research literature across multiple papers. Apply structured analysis to identify patterns, trajectories, and gaps.

## Synthesis Framework

### 1. Scope Definition
- **Research area**: What's the specific topic or problem space?
- **Boundaries**: What's included vs excluded?
- **Time period**: Historical development or recent work?
- **Key terms**: Core concepts and terminology

### 2. Paper Organization

Group papers by:
- **Approach**: What methods/techniques do they use?
- **Problem**: What specific problems do they address?
- **Time period**: Historical development and influence
- **Research group**: Who's working on this?
- **Results**: Performance levels or findings

### 3. Trajectory Analysis

**Historical development**:
- What are the foundational papers?
- How has the field evolved?
- What were the key breakthroughs?
- What approaches were tried and abandoned? Why?

**Current state**:
- What's the SOTA?
- What are the dominant paradigms?
- What's under active development?
- Where is there consensus vs debate?

**Future directions**:
- What are the open problems?
- What are researchers currently pursuing?
- What seems promising but underexplored?

### 4. Technical Analysis

**Methods & Approaches**:
- What are the main technique families?
- How do they compare? Tradeoffs?
- What's been tried? What hasn't?
- Any contradictory results?

**Evaluation & Metrics**:
- What benchmarks are used?
- Are they adequate? What's missing?
- Can results be compared across papers?
- Any methodological issues?

### 5. Results & Evidence

**Performance landscape**:
- What's the state of results?
- How much progress over time?
- Diminishing returns or still improving?
- Are improvements real or artifacts?

**Replication & Robustness**:
- What's been replicated?
- What's based on single papers?
- Any failures to replicate?
- How robust are findings?

### 6. Identify Gaps

**Empirical gaps**:
- What hasn't been tested?
- What datasets/domains are missing?
- What comparisons haven't been done?

**Theoretical gaps**:
- What lacks explanation?
- What's understood empirically but not theoretically?
- What assumptions are untested?

**Methodological gaps**:
- What evaluation is missing?
- What ablations haven't been done?
- What metrics should be used but aren't?

### 7. Critical Assessment

**Strengths of the literature**:
- What's well-established?
- What's been thoroughly studied?
- What are the reliable findings?

**Weaknesses & Limitations**:
- What's overhyped?
- Where are the methodological flaws?
- What's based on weak evidence?
- What claims lack support?

**Consensus vs Debate**:
- Where do researchers agree?
- What's controversial?
- What are the competing hypotheses?

### 8. Practical Implications

**For practitioners**:
- What should be used in practice?
- What works reliably vs what's fragile?
- What's overly complex vs what's essential?

**For researchers**:
- What are the high-value open problems?
- Where is low-hanging fruit?
- Where is more work needed?

## Output Structure

Provide:

1. **Overview**: High-level summary of the research area
2. **Taxonomy**: Organization of papers by approach/problem
3. **Historical Development**: Key papers and evolution over time
4. **Technical Summary**: Methods, results, comparisons
5. **Gaps & Opportunities**: What's missing or underexplored
6. **Critical Analysis**: Strengths and weaknesses of current work
7. **Recommendations**: What to read, what to build on, what to avoid

## Synthesis Strategies

**Quantitative synthesis**:
- Compare numbers across papers
- Track metrics over time
- Identify performance trends
- Build comparison tables

**Conceptual synthesis**:
- Map concepts and relationships
- Identify paradigm shifts
- Trace idea lineages
- Find conceptual gaps

**Methodological synthesis**:
- Compare experimental designs
- Assess evaluation quality
- Identify best practices
- Spot common pitfalls

## Critical Reading Principles

- **Verify claims**: Check if conclusions follow from evidence
- **Check citations**: Do papers accurately represent prior work?
- **Compare claims**: Do papers contradict each other? Why?
- **Assess quality**: Strong methods vs weak evidence
- **Context matters**: Venue, date, research group influence

## When to Use This Skill

- Conducting literature reviews for papers
- Understanding a new research area
- Identifying research directions
- Comparing multiple approaches to a problem
- Finding gaps for potential contributions
- Assessing state of the field

## Tools & Approaches

When synthesizing:
- **Search systematically**: Don't just read what's popular
- **Follow citations**: Both forward and backward
- **Check multiple sources**: Different perspectives
- **Track over time**: Evolution of ideas
- **Organize notes**: Structured format for comparison
- **Revisit periodically**: Understanding deepens with rereading
